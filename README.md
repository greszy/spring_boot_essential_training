# Spring Boot Essential Training

## Overview

Welcome to one of my practice repositories where I study and share my findings about Spring Boot. 
The base code of this repo is based on a LinkedIn Learning course titled [Spring Boot 2.0 Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/spring-boot-2-0-essential-training-2/spring-into-spring?autoAdvance=true&autoSkip=false&autoplay=true&contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A5b101b04498e06fb6e2d8785&resume=true&u=78163626). 
The author of the course is Frank P Moley III. 
Part of my studies involves following tutorials and courses I can find online that I think I will find useful to learn from. 
I find these kind of study materials useful, especially when it involves some new programming frameworks like Spring. 
Before I jump into building bigger projects, I always like to go over easier demos to get a better feeling of what the framework is offering. 
Frank Moley's course is a great example of that kind of educational content. It offers a great overview of Spring Boot, combining both short-form lectures and code examples. 
You can read my full review about the Spring Boot 2.0 Essential Training, here on my [blog](https://medium.com/@gregoryszy/introduction-3d69f1278f84) on Medium. 
You will see a lot of additional comments over the code. That is my way of taking notes, so I can solidify my understanding about what a specific line of code does and how does it relate to the whole project. 
Over time you can expect me to add additional comments. I will also be adding some new examples while I continue to try different elements of Spring Boot. 
I treat these types of repositories as a playground where I can test new framework features, learn more about how to properly use Github and practice my writing skills. 

## Key Topics
